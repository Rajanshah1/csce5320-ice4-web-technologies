# ICE-4: Scientific Data Visualization

**Course:** CSCE 5320 — Scientific Data Visualization  
**Assignment:** ICE-4 — Introduction to Web Technologies  
**Author:** Rajan Shah

## 📌 Overview
This assignment demonstrates the use of **SVG, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js** to build and visualize web-based graphics.

It is divided into three main parts:

1. **SVG + CSS**  
   - Created a custom SVG in Figma and exported it as `myArt.svg`.  
   - Built an HTML page (`index.html`) with embedded SVG.  
   - Styled the page with a custom `style.css` file.

2. **JavaScript Basics**  
   - Added a JS file (`js/example.js`) that displays an **alert box** with my name when the page loads.  
   - Verified JavaScript linking by running the webpage in a browser.

3. **CodePen + D3.js Scene**  
   - Designed a natural scene with **five different elements** using **D3.js**:  
     - Tree (Figma-style, grounded to the soil)  
     - Flower (centered between tree and cat)  
     - Cat  
     - Dog  
     - Birds  
     - Butterflies  
   - Used D3 primitives (`rect`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, `path`) to create each element.  
   - Fixed positioning issues so the **tree is attached to the ground** and the **flower is correctly aligned**.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser → webpage loads with SVG + CSS.  
2. JS alert (from `js/example.js`) will appear with my name.  
3. Visit CodePen link below to view the **D3.js scene**.

## 🌳 D3.js Natural Scene Elements
The following elements are present in my scene:
- **Tree:** trunk + multiple canopy ellipses, shadow grounded.  
- **Flower:** stem, petals, center; positioned between cat and tree.  
- **Cat:** body, head, ears, nose, tail, legs.  
- **Dog:** body, head, ears, tail, legs.  
- **Birds:** body, wings, beak, eyes.  
- **Butterflies:** left & right wings, body, antennae.

## 📖 Reflection
Through this assignment, I learned:
- How to **embed SVGs** in HTML and style them with CSS.  
- Basics of **JavaScript integration** and event handling in webpages.  
- How to create **shapes with D3.js** and group/transform elements.  
- Positioning strategies (e.g., aligning the tree trunk with the ground, centering the flower between objects).  
- Sharing and testing interactive graphics in **CodePen**.

- Screenshot of JS alert box.  
- Screenshot of D3.js scene + CodePen link.  
- README.md file (this document).
